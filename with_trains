# This datafile adds a trainstop that can offload in 15 seconds
# as a way to provide basic inputs, to help plan the needed number of stations.

# change the denominator here to change assumed time for train arrive + offload + leave.
Train Station builds at 1/15

# We're assuming trains have 4 full cargo wagons of product = 160 stacks
# eg. ores have a stack size of 50, 50 * 160 = 8000
8000 iron ore takes 1 in train station
8000 copper core takes 1 in train station
8000 coal takes 1 in train station

# Even in a train-based system, we don't bother training water
Offshore Pump builds at 60
2000 water takes 1 in offshore pump
