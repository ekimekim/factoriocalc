# Special 'items' that aren't really items
# A rocket could be represented by 100 rocket parts, but that doesn't really capture
# the non-parallelizable nature of it and that the actual launch takes time during which you
# can't build more rocket parts. So we represent rocket as one entire launch including launch time.
# Online sources tell me launch time is ~41 seconds. So total time = 3s * 100 parts + 41s = 341s.
# This will break once modules are taken into account.
