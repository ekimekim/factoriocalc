# Special 'items' that aren't really items
# A rocket could be represented by 100 rocket parts, but that doesn't really capture
# the non-parallelizable nature of it and that the actual launch takes time during which you
# can't build more rocket parts. So we represent rocket as one entire launch including launch time.
# Online sources tell me launch time is ~41 seconds. So total time = 3s * 100 parts + 41s = 341s.
# We pass this in as "300 plus 41 delay", which tells the calculator that the 41 can't be sped up.
Rocket takes 300 in rocket silo, 1000 low density structure, 1000 rocket control unit, 1000 rocket fuel, can take productivity, plus 41 delay, is virtual
# Similarly, 1000 white science is not its own step, it's another kind of rocket launch.
1000 white science takes 300 in rocket silo, 1000 low density structure, 1000 rocket control unit, 1000 rocket fuel, can take productivity, plus 41 delay, plus 1 satellite
# For convenience, a wrapper that represents one unit of science at the 'infinite science' level,
